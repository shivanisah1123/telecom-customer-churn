## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a telecommunications dataset to uncover hidden patterns behind customer churn.
Using Python, along with libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I explored various factors influencing customer decisions to stay or leave.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used

## Python:
 Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis

## Pandas:
 DataFrame operations for organizing and analyzing data

## Seaborn and Matplotlib: 
  Creating insightful visualizations to identify trends
  
## Numpy:
  Supporting numerical operations

## Jupyter Notebook:
  For interactive data exploration and analysis


## 🔑 Key Highlights

. Analyzed 7,043 customer records with 21 different attributes

. Explored key factors such as contract types, online services, and their impact on customer churn

. Built compelling visualizations to illustrate complex relationships

. Developed actionable insights to reduce customer churn for telecom companies


## 📊 Key Findings

1. 26.54% of customers churned—this is a significant number that requires business attention!


2. Fiber optic internet users showed higher churn rates despite better service quality.


3. Lack of online security and backup services strongly correlated with higher churn rates.



## 🎯 Takeaways & Learnings

Enhanced my skills in Python for data analysis and manipulation.

Gained experience in creating data visualizations to uncover actionable business insights.

Learned to make data-driven decisions for reducing customer churn.


## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains 21 attributes related to customers such as:

. Customer ID, Contract Type, Internet Service Type
